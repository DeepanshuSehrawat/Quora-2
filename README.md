# Quora Clone

## üöÄ About The Project

This project is a minimalist, interactive front-end clone of Quora built with **React**. It demonstrates core React concepts, including state management, component-based architecture, and user interaction, all styled beautifully with **Tailwind CSS**.

It's a single-page application that simulates the core functionalities of a question-and-answer platform:

* **User Authentication**: A modal allows users to both sign in and sign up.
* **Dynamic Content**: Features a feed of sample questions and their answers.
* **Search Functionality**: A search bar filters questions by title, content, or tags in real-time.
* **Question and Answer Posting**: Logged-in users can post new questions and submit answers to existing ones.
* **Voting System**: Users can upvote and downvote answers, with a visual state indicating their vote.

**Important Note**: This is a **front-end only** application. All user data, questions, and answers are stored in the component's React state and are **not persisted**. Refreshing the page will reset all data to its initial sample state.

### Key Features
* **Home Feed**: Browse a list of all questions.
* **Search Bar**: Quickly find questions by title, content, or tags.
* **Authentication Flow**: Seamless sign-up and login experience via a modal.
* **Create Questions**: Logged-in users can add new questions to the feed.
* **Post Answers**: Contribute to questions by writing and posting answers.
* **Voting**: Interact with answers by upvoting or downvoting them.
